# DevOps

## What is DevOps ?

### _DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the life cycle of systems and applications. The goal of DevOps is to bring developers and operations staff together to complete software development and delivery faster, with more reliability and at a higher quality._

### _DevOps practices include version control, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring._

### _DevOps aims to improve collaboration and communication between these two traditionally separate groups and to automate parts of the process where possible, so that organizations can deliver value to their customers more quickly._
