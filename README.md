## What is DevOps ?

### DevOps is a set of practices that combines <span style="color:#FFB100"> _software development (Dev)_ </span> and <span style="color:#FFB100"> _information technology operations (Ops)_ </span> to shorten the life cycle of systems and applications. The goal of DevOps is to bring developers and operations staff together to complete software development and delivery faster, with more reliability and at a higher quality

### DevOps practices include <span style="color:#FFB100"> _version control, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring._</span>  DevOps is a cultural movement that promotes collaboration and communication between software developers and IT operations professionals

### DevOps aims to improve collaboration and communication between these two traditionally separate groups and to automate parts of the process where possible, so that organizations can deliver value to their customers more quickly
