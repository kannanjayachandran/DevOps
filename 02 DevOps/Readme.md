# What is DevOps?

</div>

<h2>

DevOps can be defined as a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the life cycle of systems or applications, improve reliability and security, and reduce the time it takes to deliver new features, and most importantly bring developers and operations staff together and thus improve collaboration and communication between these two traditionally separate groups.
</h2>

> DevOps is a cultural movement that promotes collaboration and communication between software developers and IT operations professionals. Although the tools and practices of DevOps are important and quite necessary in the modern world, the most important aspect of DevOps is the culture that it promotes. DevOps aims to bring automation wherever possible, so that organizations can deliver value to their customers more quickly.

## Main DevOps Ideologies

- **Continuous Integration** - Developers integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
- **Continuous Delivery** - Once code is integrated, it is automatically tested and prepared for a release to production. Continuous delivery ensures that software can be reliably released at any time.
- **Continuous Deployment** - Continuous deployment goes a step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. This requires a great deal of automation and a culture of frequent, small releases.

## DevOps Practices

- **Version Control** - Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Version control is a critical component of DevOps because it allows teams to collaborate on code and share changes without overwriting each other's work.
- **Continuous Integration** - Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.
- **Continuous Delivery** - Once code is integrated, it is automatically tested and prepared for a release to production. Continuous delivery ensures that software can be reliably released at any time.
- **Continuous Deployment** - Continuous deployment goes a step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. This requires a great deal of automation and a culture of frequent, small releases.
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
- **Configuration Management** - Configuration management is the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time. Configuration management is a critical component of DevOps because it allows teams to automate the deployment and management of their infrastructure.
- **Monitoring** - Monitoring is the process of observing a system over time to detect changes in its performance or behavior. Monitoring is a critical component of DevOps because it allows teams to detect and resolve issues quickly.
- **Automation** - Automation is the process of automating repetitive tasks that are performed on a computer, server, or network device. Automation is a critical component of DevOps because it allows teams to deploy and manage their infrastructure quickly and reliably.
- **Orchestration** - Orchestration is the automated coordination of complex IT processes. Orchestration is a critical component of DevOps because it allows teams to automate the deployment and management of their infrastructure.
- **Microservices** - Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities. The microservices architecture enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
- **Containers** - Containers are a way to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. Containers are a critical component of DevOps because they allow teams to package and deploy their applications quickly and reliably.
- **Cloud Computing** - Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Cloud computing is a critical component of DevOps because it allows teams to deploy and manage their infrastructure quickly and reliably.
- **Continuous Testing** - Continuous testing is the practice of testing software throughout the software development lifecycle. Continuous testing is a critical component of DevOps because it allows teams to detect and resolve issues quickly.
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Continuous monitoring is the practice of monitoring software throughout the software development lifecycle. Continuous monitoring is a critical component of DevOps because it allows teams to detect and resolve issues quickly.
- **Continuous Feedback** - Continuous feedback is the practice of gathering feedback from users throughout the software development lifecycle. Continuous feedback is a critical component of DevOps because it allows teams to detect and resolve issues quickly.
