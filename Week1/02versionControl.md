# Version Control

**Version control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that we can recall specific versions later. It does not need to be a software, version control can keep track of any kind of files in a computer. Version control is a very important part of **DevOps** also, as it allows us to keep track of changes and revert back to previous versions if needed. It also allows us to collaborate with other developers on the same project. version control also plays a key role in **CI/CD**.

There are many version control systems available, some of the most popular ones are:

- **Git**
- **Mercurial**
- **Subversion**
- **CVS**

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system. It is the most popular version control system in the world. It is used by many companies and organizations, Git is a free and open source software. Git allows us to keep track of changes in our code, it also allows us to collaborate with other developers on the same project. Git is a very important part of DevOps, it allows us to keep track of changes and revert back to previous versions if needed. It also allows us to collaborate with other developers on the same project. Git also plays a key role in CI/CD. We can use services like GitHub to host our repositories remotely.

### Essential Git commands

- `git init` - Initialize a local git repository
- `git add` - Add files to staging area
- `git add .` - Add all the files in the current directory to staging area
- `git commit -m "commit message"` - Commit changes to local repository
- `git push` - Push changes to remote repository
- `git pull` - Pull changes from remote repository
- `git clone` - Clone a remote repository
- `git status` - Check the status of the local repository
- `git log` - Check the commit history
- `git checkout` - Switch between branches
- `git branch` - Create a new branch
- `git merge` - Merge branches

### Git Branching

Git branching refers to the creation of a new branch in the repository. Branching is a very important part of Git, it allows us to work on multiple features at the same time. It also allows us to work on a feature without affecting the main branch. Branching also a crucial part of DevOps, it allows us to work on multiple features at the same time. The concept of branches exits in order to cleanly divide the work of different developers. It is a good practice to create branches for each feature and each bug-fixes.
